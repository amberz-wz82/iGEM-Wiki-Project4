    Cornell iGEMâ€™s goals for the 2020 season have shifted rapidly as the global situation involving COVID-19 has continued developing. Our initial direction was to complete an iGEM project as we do normally, aiming for gold medal classification when we compete at the 2020 Giant Jamboree. However, due to the impact of COVID-19, we are largely unable to perform work in-person and accordingly we are most likely unable to create a physical product for the 2020 season. While this is unfortunate, the situation at hand has allowed for much personal growth amongst team members and leaders.
Though we may not produce a physical product for the 2020 Giant Jamboree, we still must prepare for the competition. Without lab work as a requirement, teams this year are being judged largely on factors related to modeling, business plans, proof-of-concept, etc. Essentially, the hypotheticals and designs of the original product. Cornell iGEM members have acquired new skillsets as a result of this, being required to apply themselves outside of their comfort zone to learn about previously unfamiliar disciplines; for example, our Wet Lab members have been modeling equations in MATLAB. Teaching iGEM students the skills necessary to assemble this new type of project is at the forefront of our team goals this year.
Beyond acquiring specific new skills related to certain disciplines, iGEM team members have also experienced great personal growth in 2020. This is due to our goals for the 2020 season having shifted from an output and results-based approach to an approach centered around personal growth, flexibility, and accountability. Through conducting our meetings and operations completely virtually, every team member has improved their communication skills and has developed a better sense of accountability, since there is less strict direction from the leads in a remote work environment. Though COVID-19 strongly impacted the workflow of our team, we are still working hard to ensure that every team member leaves having learned something valuable.
